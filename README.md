## About The Project

This project trains several models (**Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **Logistic Regression**) on a public cardiovascular dataset to predict disease presence. The workflow includes:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** to identify distributions, outliers, and feature correlations.  
2. **Feature engineering & scaling** for numeric and categorical variables.  
3. **Model training & hyperparameter tuning** via randomized search.  
4. **Evaluation** with confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.
